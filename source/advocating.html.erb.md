## Involve experts and people with disabilities

Experts and people with disabilities will help build understanding of the barriers faced and what accommodations can help in removing them. Stories of how people with disabilities use the web can also help develop understanding of the principles of and need for web accessibility. Use these stories as cases studies when building awareness and, potentially, as personas for implementation teams.
