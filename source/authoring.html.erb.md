##  Keep it short and simple 

Write in short, clear sentences and paragraphs. Front-load important messages. Split complex prose into a few short sentences.
 
{::nomarkdown}
<%= example_start %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example_end %>
{:/}

## Avoid using complex words

Avoid using words more complicated than the audience needs. Some audiences, such as in academia, require complex terminology, but still seek for opportunities to simplify. When content requires possibly unfamiliar terms, include a glossary. 

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example_start %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example_end %>
{:/}

## Expand all acronyms on their first use

When first used on a page, ensure that acronyms are fully expanded. Follow the expansion with the acronym. Some extremely common acronyms may be better known than the expanded form, for example, BBC, or HTML. In such cases, an expansion may not be necessary, although avoid assuming internal organizational acronyms are as well known.

<%= example_start %>

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example_end %>
{:/}

## Make link text clear

Try to write link text so that it would make sense out of context. Link text should describe the content of the link target in a meaningful way. Avoid using link text such as 'click here', 'find out more', or 'read more'. Where the link target is not HTML, indicate the document type and approximate size in the link text.

<%= example_start %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example_end %>
{:/}

## Provide short, meaningful headings to break-up text

Use clear and simple headings to split up text into manageable chunks. Headings should be short and aim to describe or introduce the following section. They should not confuse readers as to what the following section should be about.  

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example_start %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example_end %>
{:/}

## Use informative and unique page titles

The title of a page should be unique within the website and should simply describe the page content. For pages that are part of a multi-step process, consider including the stage within the title.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example_start %>
{:/}

[... Example of simple title, title and webpage title, and title as part of process ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example_end %>
{:/}

## Provide alternative text for all images

Each image used should be provided with alternative text that describes the information of function represented by the image. Provide text that describes the purpose the image serves or what information it conveys. Where an image is purely decorative, `null` alternative text may be appropriate.

## Provide transcripts and captions for multimedia content

For all multimedia content, provide transcripts of the content. The transcript should include any additional descriptions that are important for understanding the content. For multimedia content that includes video, captions may be required. Similar to the transcript, the captions provide a text version of the audio content, but with the addition of timing markers to indicate when in the video the text should be presented.
