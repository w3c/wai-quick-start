## Use progressive enhancement

Progressive enhancement starts with the basic core semantic HTML presenting the content and functionality. Additional styling and functionality are then progressively added with different technologies, such as CSS or JavaScript. If the added technology is not available, such as behind a firewall that prevents JavaScript, the core content will still be available.

## Adopt a responsive design approach

Use responsive design to adapt the content to different screen sizes, such as on mobile devices and tables. Elements can be condensed or rearranged when less space is available. Use <abbr="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> media queries to target styling depending on the width of the viewport. Use `em` or `rem` units in the queries to make sure that the design adapts when changing the font size.

## Use mark-up to convey meaning and structure

Use structural elements to mark-up headings, lists, and paragraphs. HTML5 provides additional elements, such as `<nav>` and `<aside>`, to better structure your documents. Also WAI-ARIA roles can be used to provide structure, for example, using `role='search'` to identify search functionality. Work with designers and content authors to ensure the given meaning is agreed and consistently used.

## Associate all form elements with labels

Associate the `<label>` element with form elements using the *for* and *id* attributes. If there is not a visible label, provide a label and position it offscreen using CSS. 

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

    <label for="username">
    <input id="username" type="text">

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>

## Help users avoid and correct mistakes

Provide clear instructions on required information formats, such as for dates and phone numbers. Be as forgiving of format as possible when accepting information. For example, accept phone numbers that include spaces and delete the spaces as needed. Clearly identify errors that cannot be auto-corrected, including a description of the specific error, where it occurred, and how to correct it. Provide an in-page link for easy access from the error to the field when feasible.

## Reflect the reading order in the code order

Ensure that the order of elements in the code matches the logical order of the information when presented visually. This can be checked by removing CSS styling and comparing the order of the content with the visual hierarchy of the page.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Example of code order versus visual order ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>

<%= tip :end %>

## Provide meaning to non-standard interactive elements 

For custom widgets, such as accordions and custom-made buttons, use WAI-ARIA to provide information about the widget and its current state. For example, 'role='button'' and 'state='pressed'' provide information about the widget within the code (additional code is still required to implement the behavior of such widgets, such as pressing interaction).

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Example of hamburger menu, list of images as radio select, or collapsable accordion ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

{:.attach_permalink}
## Ensure that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

This is easily checked by trying to interact with a page using the keyboard only. If some functionality, is not reachable using just the keyboard then there is a problem. Think about keyboard access when developing new interactive elements, such as menus, collapsable accordions, or media players.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... **Note:** May be too complex to create an example for ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

## Check that your code validates

Validate HTML and CSS to identify possible compatibility problems. Fix identified problems to reduce the risk of errors on different devices.

{::nomarkdown}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= learn_more :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>

## Learn more about accessibility

These tips are important points to consider when developing accessible websites, but there is always more to learn. The following resources will help you find out more about accessibility, why it is important, and what guidelines exist to help support people with disabilities accessing the web.
