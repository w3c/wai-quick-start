## Begin with coarse accessibility checks to gain first impressions and experiences

Many accessibility checks can be carried out right away with experience in web accessibility, also by non-technical people such as content writers. While such cursory checking does not substitute for more comprehensive evaluation, it helps to understand the overall situation and plan for accessibility. Cursory checks also help identify key issues and avoid obvious mistakes during the design and development process.

## Involve and learn from real users with disabilities

Seek feedback from people with disabilities. This includes informal checking by individual users and formal usability testing with a panel of users. This helps identify subtle issues that are not easy to identify, even by experienced accessibility evaluators. Beware that processing feedback from users can be difficult and misleading without the involvement of usability professionals.

## Use evaluation tools to support your work and to learn from

While most accessibility aspects cannot be checked automatically, evaluation tools can assist throughout the design, development, and maitainance process. For example, some evaluation tools specialize on specific aspects, such as color contrast checking, while others focus on large-scale evaluation of entire websites. It is important to understand the strengths and limitation of such tools, and how they fit into your workflow.

## Perform comprehensive checks at key stages

Carry out comprehensive evaluation at key stages, such as before go-live, and periodically, to ensure that it meets the set accessibility requirements. Use a standard reporting template for evaluations, to allow for easy comparison throughout a project and across similar projects. Also capture and communicate commonly identified issues to support development teams in avoiding errors.

## Ensure accessibility reviews across the team (review teams)

Evaluating web accessibility requires diverse kinds of skills and expertise. For example, some requirements relate to the design, writing, and development aspects of a website, while others relate to assistive technologies and their use by people with disabilities. Sharing evaluation tasks in a team of reviewers can help make evaluation more effective and efficient.
