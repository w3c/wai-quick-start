## Provide informative, unique page titles

Provide unique titles to each page that simply describes page content or purpose, and distinguishes it from other pages. If including the organization's name in the title, it should usually go at the end. For pages that are part of a group, such as a multi-step process, include the stage in the page title.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Example of simple title, page title and site title together, and title as part of process ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

## Use headings to convey meaning and structure 

Use clear and simple headings to group related paragraphs. Headings should be short and describe or introduce the following section.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Example of block of text with and without headings to provide clarity and structure ...]

[... May be too long for an example, perhaps examples of using metaphor, or quirky headings ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

##  Keep content clear and concise 

Write in short, clear sentences and paragraphs, as appropriate for the context. Front-load important messages. Split complex prose into a few short sentences. Try and keep paragraphs to a single idea.
 
{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>

<div class="two-column">
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Complex text</figcaption>
    <div>
      <p class="fail">In the event of a vehicular collision, a company assigned representative will seek to ascertain the extent and cause of damages to property belonging to the parties involved. Once we obtain information that causes us to understand the causality, we will assign monetary remuneration accordingly.</p>
    </div>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Clear and simple text</figcaption>
    <div>
      <p class="pass">If you are involved in a car accident, an agent will investigate. Those findings will determine the payment of claims.</p>
    </div>
  </figure>
</div>

## Avoid using overly complex words and phrases

Avoid using words more complicated than the audience needs. Some topics may require complex terminology, such as medical or engineering texts, but simpler forms may still be possible. Provide a glossary when content includes unfamiliar terms. 

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Example using medical terminology against layman terminology... ]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

## Make link text meaningful

Write link text so that it would make sense out of context. Link text should describe the content of the link target in a meaningful way. Avoid using link text such as 'click here', 'find out more', or 'read more'. Indicate the document type and approximate size in the link text when the link target is not HTML. 

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Example of links in context, one with no out of context meaning, one clear out of context ...]

[... Example of 'click here' in sentence, contrasted with contextually meaningful link ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

{:.attach_permalink}
## Provide text alternatives for images

Assign alternative text to every image. Text must clearly describe the information or function represented by the image. Use empty alternative text when an image is purely decorative.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Some examples of images with appropriate alternative text ...]

[... Probably worth using a couple of examples from the tutorials and then linking directly there ...]
{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

## Provide transcripts and captions for multimedia

For audio-only content, such a podcast, provide transcripts. Include everything that is spoken, and descriptions of sounds that are important for understanding the content, for example 'squeaking door'. Provide this information, including the audio description, as captions when audio is used to accompany visual content, such as animations and video. The requirements vary for pre-recorded and live content.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Could include a link to a video with captions and the associated captions file. Could show a video and then include a transcript below. Both may be quite involved... ]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

## Expand acronyms on first use

Expand acronyms the first time they are used on a page. Follow the expansion with the acronym. Some extremely common acronyms may be better known than the expanded form, for example, BBC, or HTML. In such cases, an expansion may not be necessary. Avoid assuming internal organizational acronyms are as well known.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

<div class="">
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Example paragraph introducing and then referencing an acronym</figcaption>
    <div>
      <p>Since the passage of the Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA), we have seen increased use of auto generated captions. While this may be well-intentioned, auto-captioning is still quite unreliable and error-prone and does not usually fulfill the intention of the <abbr title="Communications and Video Accessibility Act">CVAA</abbr> legislation.</p>
    </div>
  </figure>
</div>

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

## Learn more about accessibility

These tips are just some of the important accessibility points to address when writing for websites. There are more things to consider. The following resources will help you learn more about accessibility — why it is important for people with disabilities, for writers, and for organizations; about web accessibility guidelines; and much more.
