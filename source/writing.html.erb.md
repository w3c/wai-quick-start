##  Keep content clear and concise 

Write in short, clear sentences and paragraphs, as appropriate for the context. Front-load important messages. Split complex prose into a few short sentences. Try and keep paragraphs to a single idea.
 
{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Contrasting example of involved text against a clear text ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>

## Avoid using overly complex words and phrases

Avoid using words more complicated than the audience needs. Some audiences, such as in doctors or engineers, require complex terminology, but still seek for opportunities to simplify. When content requires possibly unfamiliar terms, include a glossary. 

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Example using medical terminology against layman terminology... ]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

## Provide useful link text

Try to write link text so that it would make sense out of context. Link text should describe the content of the link target in a meaningful way. Avoid using link text such as 'click here', 'find out more', or 'read more'. Where the link target is not HTML, indicate the document type and approximate size in the link text.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Example of links in context, one with no out of context meaning, one clear out of context ...]

[... Example of 'click here' in sentence, contrasted with contextually meaningful link ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

## Provide meaningful headings to structure text

Use clear and simple headings to split up text into manageable chunks. Headings should be short and aim to describe or introduce the following section. They should clarify what the following section is about.  

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Example of block of text with and without headings to provide clarity and structure ...]

[... May be too long for an example, perhaps examples of using metaphor, or quirky headings ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

## Use informative and unique page titles

The title of a page should be unique within the website and should simply describe the page content. For pages that are part of a multi-step process, consider including the stage within the title.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Example of simple title, page title and site title together, and title as part of process ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

{:.attach_permalink}
## Provide text alternatives for all images

Each image used should be provided with alternative text that describes the information or function represented by the image. Provide text that describes the purpose the image serves or what information it conveys. Where an image is purely decorative, `null` alternative text may be appropriate.
 
{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Some examples of images with appropriate alternative text ...]

[... Probably worth using a couple of examples from the tutorials and then linking directly there ...]
{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

## Provide transcripts and captions for multimedia content

For all multimedia content, provide transcripts of the content. The transcript should include any additional descriptions that are important for understanding the content. For multimedia content that includes video, captions may be required. Similar to the transcript, the captions provide a text version of the audio content, but with the addition of timing markers to indicate when in the video the text should be presented.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Could include a link to a video with captions and the associated captions file. Could show a video and then include a transcript below. Both may be quite involved... ]
{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>
{:/}

## Expand all abbrs on their first use

When first used on a page, ensure that abbrs are fully expanded. Follow the expansion with the abbr. Some extremely common abbrs may be better known than the expanded form, for example, BBC, or HTML. In such cases, an expansion may not be necessary, although avoid assuming internal organizational abbrs are as well known.

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example %>
{:/}

[... Simple example of paragraph with abbr presented twice, first with it expanded second using &lt;abbr&gt; ...]

{::nomarkdown}
<%= example :end %>
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
<%= tip :end %>
<%= tip %>

## Learn more about accessibility

These tips are important points to consider when writing accessible content, but there is always more to learn. The following resources will help you find out more about accessibility, why it is important, and what guidelines exist to help support people with disabilities accessing the web.
